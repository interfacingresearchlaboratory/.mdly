# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

We are committed to making participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Taking responsibility, apologizing, and learning from mistakes
- Focusing on what is best for the community and project

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- Sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take fair, appropriate corrective action in response to behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Maintainers may remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces and also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces. Examples include using an official project email address, posting via official social media accounts, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Reporting

Report violations by opening a private security advisory on GitHub if possible, or by contacting project maintainers directly through repository ownership channels.

All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

## Enforcement

Maintainers will follow a graduated response model:

1. Correction: private warning and request to stop the behavior.
2. Warning: formal warning with consequences for continued behavior.
3. Temporary ban: temporary restriction from interaction or contribution.
4. Permanent ban: long-term or permanent restriction for severe or repeated violations.
