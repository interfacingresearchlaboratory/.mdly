## 4. What Data We Collect and Why

### 4.1 Legal Basis for Processing

Under the UK GDPR, we rely on:

- **Contract:** to create and manage your account and fulfill our obligations to you.
- **Legitimate interests:** to maintain and secure the Services, improve user experience, and diagnose issues, provided your rights don't override these interests.
- **Consent:** for non-essential cookies, analytics tracking, and any marketing communications.
- **Legal obligation:** to retain billing records, respond to law-enforcement requests, and comply with other statutory requirements.

### 4.2 Information We May Collect via Technological Means

**Log Data**
Whenever you access our Services, our servers automatically record:

- Browser type & version
- Operating system
- IP address (anonymized/truncated)
- Domain name
- Date/time stamps of visits or activities
- Pages or features accessed

We store log data to diagnose technical issues, monitor performance, and enhance security. Alone, it generally cannot identify you.

**Analytics Data**
We use **PostHog**, a privacy-focused analytics platform, to collect aggregated and event-level usage data from both our Website and App (page views, session durations, clicks, feature interactions, user flows, referring URLs/UTM parameters, device/browser metadata). We configure PostHog to respect "Do Not Track" settings by ignoring sessions where DNT is enabled, and we retain analytics data only as needed for improvement. For more information, please see PostHog's Privacy Policy: https://posthog.com/privacy
