# Routines, schedules & event dialogs

This release focuses on routines and the week view: we fixed issues with edited routines disappearing and routine blocks duplicating, improved the shell sidebar (no internal scroll, consistent routine blocks), and refreshed the Add Routine, Edit Event, and Daily Schedule dialogs. The calendar header now shows the correct date and supports hotkeys; the weekly header and Kanban page gained fixed headers. We also fixed the task context menu and minimised sidebar icons, and added the ability to set a daily schedule from the routine page.
