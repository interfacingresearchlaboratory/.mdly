# Introducing MONOid

MONOid is productivity for builders: one space to plan the week, execute inside routines that match your energy, and review what actually happened. Tasks from Notion, Linear, GitHub, and your calendar land in a single workspace so you can prioritise across domains without constant context-switching. The week is the main unit—you plan ahead, assign tasks into routine blocks (e.g. Deep Work, Admin, Meetings), and use structured reviews to close loops and keep priorities honest.

    <AccordionContent>
    - **Containers, projects & tasks** — A simple hierarchy (Containers → Projects → Tasks) keeps work organised. Tasks can come from integrations or be created in MONOid; they always have context.
    - **Routine blocks** — Recurring blocks on your week define how you spend time. Each block can limit which projects are allowed and hold assigned tasks, so your plan is schedulable, not just a list.
    - **Planning surfaces** — Calendar (weekly and daily), My Inbox (unscheduled tasks), and Kanban (all tasks) let you sort, schedule, and move work without leaving one place.
    - **Reviews** — Daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual reviews pull context from your tools so you reflect in one sitting and filter outcomes back to the right places.
