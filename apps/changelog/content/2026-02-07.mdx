# Reviews, org scope & landing

This release brings reviews and org scope into focus: organisation/container-specific reviews are now amalgamated into a single review flow, and OrgID is added to projects, tasks, and reviews. We fixed review-template bugs (org admin detection, section drag behaviour) and the Linear template embed, and improved Linear auth token refresh. The new landing page is live.

    - **Reviews & org scope** — Reviews from different organisations or containers are now combined into a single review flow. Projects, tasks, and reviews include an organisation ID so they stay scoped correctly.
    - **Review templates** — Org admin is now detected correctly on templates, and template sections can be reordered by dragging without bugs.
    - **Linear** — Creating items from the Linear template embed works correctly again, and auth token refresh is more reliable.
    - **Landing** — A new landing page is live, and the domain has been updated.
