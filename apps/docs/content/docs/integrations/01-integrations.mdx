Integrations in MONOid let you connect external tools so your planning stays in sync with the rest of your stack. This page covers what integrations can do, how connections work, and what to expect.

## What integrations can do

MONOid supports several integration patterns:

- **Sync** — Keep data in step with external systems. For example: calendar subscriptions pull in events from Google Calendar or Outlook; Linear and Notion webhooks create or update tasks, projects, and containers when something changes in those apps.
- **Import** — Bring data in from elsewhere. Today this is mainly via app integrations (e.g. Linear issues → tasks, Notion pages → containers/projects/tasks). Bulk CSV import is not available; use [Export](/integrations/02-import-export) for backup or use in other tools.
- **Embed** — Link MONOid entities to external resources. You can attach external links (e.g. Notion pages, Linear issues) to tasks, projects, and containers so you can jump straight to the source.
- **Automation** — Incoming webhooks from Linear and Notion trigger automations you configure (e.g. “when an issue is created in Linear team X, create a task and optionally a project or container”). See [API & Webhooks](/integrations/03-api-webhooks) and the [Notion](/integrations/app-integrations/01-notion) and [Linear](/integrations/app-integrations/02-linear) pages.

## Connection model (per user vs per organisation)

- **Per user** — Calendar subscriptions, API keys, and export are scoped to the signed-in user. Each user manages their own calendars and keys. Linear and Notion integrations are also **one per user** when you use a personal workspace (no organisation).
- **Per organisation** — Linear and Notion integrations are **one per organisation** when you use a workspace: one connection per workspace, shared for that org. Incoming automations (e.g. “when an issue is created in Linear, create a task”) are scoped by organisation too.

**Where to configure**

- **Personal** — Settings → Integrations. Connect or disconnect Linear and Notion for your personal space.
- **Workspace** — Workspaces → [Organisation] → Integrations (or Settings → Workspaces → select org → Integrations). Connect or disconnect for that organisation; incoming automations for that org are configured from the same place.

## Permissions and data access

- When you connect an integration (e.g. Notion or Linear), MONOid requests the minimum permissions needed to read and, where applicable, write the data used by the integration (e.g. databases or teams you select).
- Stored credentials are used only to sync or run automations you’ve configured. MONOid does not use them for unrelated access.
- API keys (Settings > Dev > API Keys) grant programmatic access to your data according to the scopes you choose (read, write, delete). Treat keys like passwords; rotate them by creating a new key and revoking the old one.

## Known limits and troubleshooting

- **Calendar sync** — Subscriptions use iCal URLs and sync about every hour. If a provider rate-limits or blocks requests, sync can fail; check Settings > Calendars for last sync status and errors.
- **Notion / Linear** — Webhooks must be reachable by our servers. If you’re behind a firewall or the provider has an outage, events may be delayed or missed. Reconnect or re-save automations if behaviour stops.
- **Export** — Large workspaces can produce large CSVs; use the entity checkboxes to export only what you need.

For connection errors, “disconnect and reconnect” often resolves them. For integration-specific issues, see the [Notion](/integrations/app-integrations/01-notion) and [Linear](/integrations/app-integrations/02-linear) pages and [Support](/getting-started/04-support).
