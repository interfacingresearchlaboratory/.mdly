The Calendar is where you schedule tasks into time. It shows your **routine blocks** in **day** or **week** view. You drag tasks from sidebars into blocks to plan what happens when.

## Views

Switch between **day view** (one day, more vertical space) and **week view** (all days side by side, best for planning the whole week) using the view toggle.

### Visual conventions

- **Wake and sleep times** — Shown as hashed (striped) bands at the top and bottom of the day. Drag the solid line at the edge to change wake or sleep time.
- **Daily schedule items** — Fixed slots (meals, buffer) shown with diagonal hashing. Tasks cannot be assigned to these.
- **Routine blocks** come in two forms:
  - **Real blocks** — Routines you've edited or that have tasks assigned. Appear solid. You can drag tasks into them and open them to see content.
  - **Template ghosts** — Placeholders from your weekly routine template for time slots you haven't filled yet. Appear faint/outlined. Adding a task or editing the block creates a real block and replaces the ghost.

### Sidebars

Tasks not yet in a block appear in two sidebars:

- **Left sidebar** — **Shaping** and **todo** tasks (in scope for the week or day). Pull work from here into blocks.
- **Right sidebar** — **Backlog** tasks (unscheduled). Pull from here or move tasks back here to unschedule.

Drag a task from either sidebar onto a routine block to link it to that block and day. A task can only be in one block at a time.

### Notes and reviews

- **Daily notes** — Free-form notes for the day, accessible at the top of the calendar.
- **Reviews** — Daily, weekly, and other review types appear at the bottom of the calendar. Click to open a review without leaving the calendar.

## Scheduling tasks

Open the Calendar, expand the sidebars, and drag tasks into routine blocks. In week view, you can move tasks between days. In day view, you get more detail for a single day. To unschedule a task, move it back to the backlog sidebar.

Tasks cannot be assigned to daily schedule blocks (sleep, meals) — only to routine/work blocks. Template ghost blocks need to be activated (by editing or assigning a task) before they behave like real blocks.
