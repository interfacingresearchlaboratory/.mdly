My Inbox shows unscheduled or soon-due tasks so you can **triage** them: clarify what they are, assign them to a project, and decide when they happen. The mental model is **clarify, assign, schedule**.

<InboxMockup />

## Triage actions

Each task in My Inbox can be moved to:

- **This week** — In scope for the current week's planning.
- **Next week** / **This month** — Deferred but still visible.
- **Backlog** — Unscheduled; appears in Calendar sidebars and Kanban until you move it.
- **Archive** — Removed from active planning.

You can also reassign a task to a different project during triage.

## Scope and filters

Choose a scope (this week, this month) to control which tasks appear. Use **filters** (project, container) and **search** to narrow the list further. Filters can be sticky per session — clear them when you want the full list back.

Where supported, **bulk actions** let you select multiple tasks and apply one action (e.g. move all to "this week") in one go.

## How to use it

Open My Inbox from the sidebar. For each task: confirm the project, then choose this week / next week / backlog / archive. Optionally aim for **inbox zero** — processing every item keeps the list trustworthy so you actually look at it.

Triage regularly. If "this week" becomes a dumping ground, move things to backlog or next week. Separating capture from scheduling keeps both fast and intentional. After triaging, switch to [Calendar](/planning/03-calendar) to assign tasks to specific routine blocks.
