The organisation layer answers "where does this live?" (containers, projects, tasks). Planning answers **"when does it happen?"** and **"what stage is it in?"** You use three surfaces:

- **[My Inbox](/planning/02-inbox)** — Capture and triage. Unscheduled tasks land here; you clarify, assign to a project, and decide timing: this week, next week, or backlog.
- **[Calendar](/planning/03-calendar)** — Schedule into time. Day and week views show routine blocks; you drag tasks from sidebars into blocks to plan your day or week.
- **[Kanban](/planning/04-kanban)** — Move work through stages. Tasks appear as cards in columns (Backlog, Todo, In Progress, Done, etc.); drag to advance.

The same task can appear across all three surfaces. Changing status on Kanban affects what shows in Calendar sidebars; scheduling on Calendar moves a task out of My Inbox. The surfaces stay in sync.

## Typical flow

1. **Triage** — Open My Inbox, process unscheduled tasks: assign project, set timing (this week / backlog).
2. **Schedule** — Open Calendar, drag "this week" tasks from sidebars into routine blocks.
3. **Track** — Open Kanban to move work through stages as you complete it.

Use **filters** (project, container) and **search** on any surface to focus on one area.
