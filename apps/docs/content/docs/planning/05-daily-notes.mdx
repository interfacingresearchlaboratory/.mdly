## What it is

Daily notes are free-form, rich-text entries tied to a specific date. They're a place to capture thoughts, context, decisions, or anything that doesn't fit into a task or review step — one note per day, per user.

## How to access daily notes

Daily notes are accessed from the **Calendar**:

- **Day view** — A daily notes row appears below the calendar events. Click it to open the editor.
- **Week view** — A daily notes row appears for each day. Click any day's row to open its note.

Clicking opens a modal with a rich text editor (the same editor used for project and task descriptions).

## Creating and editing

1. Open the **Calendar** (click **Home** in the sidebar).
2. Click the daily notes area for the date you want.
3. The editor opens — type your note. It supports rich text formatting (headings, lists, bold, italic, links, etc.).
4. Save when done. The note is stored and associated with that date.

If a note already exists for that date, clicking opens it for editing. You can also delete a note from the modal.

## Daily notes in reviews

When you open a [review](/reviews/01-overview), the **Daily Notes Viewer** shows any notes from the review's date range as read-only content. This gives you context during reflection — what you were thinking on a given day, decisions you made, or context you captured in the moment.

For daily reviews, this shows that day's note. For weekly reviews, it shows notes across the full week.

## Tips

- **Use daily notes for context, not tasks.** If something is actionable, make it a task. Daily notes are for the "why" and "what happened" that tasks don't capture.
- **Write at the end of the day.** A few sentences about what you worked on, key decisions, or blockers makes your weekly review significantly easier.
- **Don't force it.** Not every day needs a note. Use them when you have something worth remembering.
