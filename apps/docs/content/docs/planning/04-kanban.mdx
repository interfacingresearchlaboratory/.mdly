The Kanban is a board view where tasks appear as cards in columns. Each column represents a **stage**: Backlog, Shaping, Todo, In Progress, In Review, Done, Cancelled. Drag cards between columns to update status. There are no per-column WIP limits.

## Columns and grouping

By default, columns represent task **status**. You can change **board grouping** to organise the same tasks differently:

- **Status** (default) — One set of columns for all tasks.
- **Project** — One column per project (plus "No project").
- **Category** — One column per category.
- **Container** — One column per container.

When grouped by project or container, dragging a card between columns reassigns the task. When grouped by status, dragging updates the task's status — which also affects what appears in [Calendar](/planning/03-calendar) sidebars and blocks.

## Filters and search

Use **filters** (project, container) and **search** to narrow the board. Filters can be sticky per session; clear them when you want the full board. Where supported, **bulk actions** let you select multiple cards and apply one action (e.g. move to Done) in one go.

## Typical uses

- **Move work forward** — Drag cards from Todo to In Progress to Done as you complete work.
- **Review by project** — Group by project to see progress per area and spot stuck items.
- **Tidy up** — Filter by container or project, then reassign or close stray tasks.

After updating status on Kanban, the Calendar and My Inbox reflect the changes automatically.
