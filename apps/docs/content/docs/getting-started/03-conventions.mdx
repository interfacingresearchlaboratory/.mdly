## Index Pages

Each core entity in **MONOid** (containers, projects, tasks, routine blocks, reviews) has a dedicated index page that supports view customisation. These pages are accessible via the left-hand shell sidebar.

Index pages can typically be viewed:
- across the whole workspace (e.g. all projects), or
- in scoped contexts (e.g. projects within a specific container).

### Display Configuration

Each index page includes a set of display utilities at the top, typically including:

- **Search**
- **Filters**
- **Display config** (choose which properties show, and how they render)

Filters help narrow what you're looking at, while display config changes the way information is presented so the view fits the job you're doing.

### Views (List, Kanban)

Most entities support multiple view modes:

- **List View**: A tabular view showing items in rows with columns for properties. Best for scanning, comparing, and bulk editing.
- **Kanban View**: A board view for organising items into columns based on a grouping property (commonly status). Best for workflow and progress.

> Tasks also have dedicated planning surfaces (Calendar + My Inbox) covered below.

### Grouping

Items can be organised using grouping options:

- **Primary grouping**: the main grouping logic (e.g. status, priority, container, project, none)
- **Secondary grouping**: an additional layer when you need more structure
- **Board grouping**: for kanban, determines the columns shown

Grouping helps you reshape the same dataset depending on what you're trying to see.

### Property Toggles

Each view lets you toggle which properties are visible so you can focus on what matters right now.

Common property groups include:

- Status / bucket, category
- Dates and timestamps
- Relationships (container, project, routine block)

### Compactness

Control how dense the UI is:

- **Compact**: more items visible, less breathing room
- **Regular**: balanced spacing
- **Relaxed**: easiest to read, more space

## Detail Pages

Detail pages provide in-depth information and editing capabilities for individual entities. Each detail page follows consistent patterns for navigation and interaction.

### Main Content

Detail pages centre around a main content area for notes, context, and decisions — the place where the "why" lives alongside the "what".

### Property Sidebar

Detail pages include a property sidebar (desktop) for key metadata and relationships, such as:

- Status and priority
- Dates
- Container / project relationships
- Routine Block assignment (for tasks)
- System metadata (created, updated, etc.)

On smaller screens, this collapses to keep the page usable.

### Tabs

Some detail pages use tabs to separate different aspects of an entity (depending on the entity type), for example:

- **Overview** (core info + notes)
- **Tasks** (for containers/projects)
- **Activity / History** (when available)

Tabs help you navigate without losing context, and the active tab is reflected in the URL so specific views can be shared.
