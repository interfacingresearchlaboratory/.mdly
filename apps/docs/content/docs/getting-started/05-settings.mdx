Settings is where you configure your MONOid account, manage workspaces, connect integrations, and customise templates. Open it from the **gear icon** at the bottom of the left sidebar.

## Account

Manage your profile information:

- **Profile picture** — Upload or change your avatar.
- **First name / Last name** — Your display name across MONOid.
- **Email** — Your account email (managed through your auth provider).
- **Bio** — A short description visible to workspace members.
- **Delete account** — Permanently remove your account and all data.

## Preferences

Adjust how MONOid behaves for you:

- **First day of week** — Choose Sunday or Monday. This affects the Calendar week view, date pickers, and how weeks are numbered.

## Security

Manage authentication and security settings through your account provider.

## Billing

Manage your subscription. Some features — such as monthly, quarterly, and annual reviews, extended review history, and organisation workspaces — require a paid plan. Visit [usemonoid.com](https://usemonoid.com) for plan details.

## Workspaces

MONOid supports two types of workspaces:

### Personal workspace

Your default workspace. Containers, projects, tasks, and reviews you create here are private to you. No members, no sharing.

Access personal workspace settings at **Settings > Workspaces > Personal**. From here you can manage templates for containers, projects, tasks, and reviews.

### Organisation workspaces

Organisation workspaces let teams share containers, projects, and review templates. They're powered by organisations — create one from the Workspaces tab.

**Creating an organisation:**
1. Go to **Settings > Workspaces**.
2. Click **Create Organisation**.
3. Enter a name.
4. The organisation is created and set as your active workspace.

**Managing members:**
- Invite members by email.
- Assign roles: **Admin** (full control, manage members, templates, and settings) or **Member** (standard access).
- Remove members or revoke pending invitations.

**Switching workspaces:**
Use the workspace switcher in Settings or the sidebar to switch between your personal workspace and any organisations you belong to. The active workspace determines which containers, projects, and tasks you see.

**Organisation settings (admins):**
- Upload an organisation icon/logo.
- Manage review templates that apply to all members (see [Organisation Templates](/reviews/06-organisation-templates)).
- Delete the organisation (irreversible, requires confirmation).

## Calendars

Manage external calendar subscriptions. Events from connected calendars appear on the MONOid [Calendar](/planning/03-calendar).

- **Add Calendar** — Paste an iCal URL, give it a name, and choose a colour. Supported providers: Google Calendar, Outlook, Apple Calendar.
- **Sync** — Calendars sync automatically roughly every hour. Use the manual sync button to force a refresh.
- **Visibility** — Toggle calendar visibility from the sidebar (eye icon) to show or hide events.
- **Edit / Delete** — Change the name, colour, or URL. Delete to remove the subscription.

For setup instructions by provider, see [Calendar Sync](/integrations/04-calendar-sync).

## Integrations

Connect external tools to MONOid:

- **Notion** — Connect via OAuth, then configure automations to create containers, projects, or tasks from Notion pages. See [Notion](/integrations/app-integrations/01-notion).
- **Linear** — Connect via OAuth, then map Linear teams and projects to MONOid entities. See [Linear](/integrations/app-integrations/02-linear).

Disconnect and reconnect to resolve most connection issues.

## Export

Export your data as CSV files. Choose which entities to include:

- Projects
- Tasks
- Reviews
- Accomplishments

Go to **Settings > Export**, select the entities, and download. Large workspaces may produce large files — use the checkboxes to export only what you need.

## API Keys

Generate API keys for programmatic access to your MONOid data.

1. Go to **Settings > API Keys**.
2. Click **Create API Key**.
3. Choose scopes: **read**, **write**, **delete**.
4. Copy the key — it's shown only once.

Treat API keys like passwords. Rotate by creating a new key and revoking the old one. For more, see [API & Webhooks](/integrations/03-api-webhooks).

## Templates

Templates define default structures for entities you create. MONOid supports templates for:

- **Reviews** — Define the steps, prompts, and embeds for each review cadence (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annual). Templates can be personal or organisation-level. See [Templates](/reviews/05-templates).
- **Projects** — Set default fields and structure for new projects.
- **Tasks** — Set default fields for new tasks.
- **Containers** — Set default structure for new containers.

Access templates from **Settings > Workspaces > [workspace] > [entity type]**, or from the Templates section in Settings.

Organisation admins can create shared templates that apply to all members. Personal templates are private and appear alongside org templates in review flows. See [How Templates Merge](/reviews/08-how-templates-merge) for how personal and org review templates combine.
