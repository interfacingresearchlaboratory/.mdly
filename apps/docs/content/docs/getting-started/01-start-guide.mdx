MONOid is a lightweight weekly planning system designed to help people and teams decide what matters, shape a believable week, and build a steady review rhythm.

The goal is to create clarity without turning planning into a productivity contest — so your decisions can reflect priorities, energy, responsibilities, and real constraints (not just output).

This guide walks you through everything you need to go from a blank workspace to a working weekly plan.

---

## Step 1: Create your first container (2 minutes)

Containers are your top-level groupings — think of them as areas of responsibility (e.g. *Work*, *Side Project*, *Home*).

1. Open **Containers** from the left sidebar.
2. Click **Create Container**.
3. Give it a name (e.g. "Work") and an optional description.
4. Press **Cmd+Enter** (or click the button) to save.

Start small — **2–3 containers** is plenty. You can always add more later.

> **Tip:** Don't over-organise upfront. A container per life area is a good starting point. You can restructure as your workflow becomes clearer.

## Step 2: Add a few projects (3 minutes)

Projects live inside containers and represent ongoing efforts with outcomes (e.g. *Launch marketing site*, *Q1 hiring*).

1. Open **Projects** from the left sidebar.
2. Click **Create Project**.
3. Enter a title, pick a container, and set the status to **Active**.
4. Repeat for 2–4 projects across your containers.

Keep projects outcome-oriented — each should answer "what am I trying to achieve?"

## Step 3: Add tasks to your projects (3 minutes)

Tasks are the concrete actions that move projects forward (e.g. *Write first draft*, *Set up CI pipeline*).

1. Open **Tasks** from the left sidebar.
2. Click **Create Task**.
3. Enter a title — the task will default to **Backlog**.
4. You can also create tasks directly from a project's detail page.

Don't try to capture everything. Start with **5–10 tasks** that feel relevant this week. You'll add more as you go.

## Step 4: Set up your routine blocks (5 minutes)

Routine blocks define the structure of your week — the recurring time slots that shape when different types of work happen (e.g. *Deep Work*, *Admin*, *Meetings*).

1. Open **Routines** from the sidebar (in the collapsible section below the main nav).
2. Click **Wake & Sleep** to set your daily start and end times.
3. Click **Add Routine** to create your first block:
   - Give it a name (e.g. "Deep Work").
   - Pick which days of the week it recurs on.
   - Set a start and end time.
   - Choose a colour.
4. Repeat for 2–4 blocks that reflect how you actually spend your week.

> **Tip:** Plan less than you think you can do. Leave gaps between blocks. A believable week has breathing room built in.

You can optionally add **daily schedule items** (meals, breaks) using the **Add Daily Schedule** button — tasks can't be assigned to these, but they help you see your full day.

## Step 5: Plan your week on the Calendar (5 minutes)

The **Calendar** is where planning becomes real. It's your home page.

1. Click **Home** in the sidebar to open the Calendar.
2. Switch to **Week view** to see all your routine blocks laid out.
3. Expand the **left sidebar** — you'll see your **shaping** and **todo** tasks (work in scope for the week).
4. Expand the **right sidebar** — you'll see **backlog** tasks (unscheduled).
5. **Drag tasks** from either sidebar into a routine block to schedule them.

A task can only be in one block at a time. To unschedule, drag it back to the backlog sidebar.

You'll notice two kinds of blocks:
- **Solid blocks** — real blocks with tasks or edits.
- **Faint/outlined blocks** — template ghosts from your routine. Adding a task or editing the block turns it into a real block.

## Step 6: Triage My Inbox

Not everything needs to be scheduled immediately. **My Inbox** is where unscheduled tasks land.

1. Open **My Inbox** from the sidebar.
2. You'll see tasks split into **This week** and **This month** tabs.
3. For each task, decide:
   - **This week** — move it to a project and set the bucket to *todo* or *shaping*.
   - **Backlog** — leave it for later.
   - **Reassign** — move it to a different project if it landed in the wrong place.

Check My Inbox regularly (daily is ideal) so unscheduled tasks don't pile up.

## Step 7: Do your first review (end of week 1)

Reviews are the reflection layer that keeps your system honest. Start with a **Weekly Review** at the end of your first week.

1. Open **Reviews** from the sidebar.
2. Click **Create Review** and select **Weekly**.
3. The review opens with template steps to guide you:
   - Work through each step — log **accomplishments** and **disappointments**, linking them to projects or tasks.
   - Check the **Projects** and **Tasks** panels on the right to see what shipped and what's stuck.
4. Use your answers to update tasks, shift priorities, and plan the next week.

A weekly review takes 15–30 minutes. It's the single most valuable habit you can build in MONOid.

> **Tip:** Do a short **Daily Review** too (5–10 minutes). It helps you close loops and stay aligned day to day.

## Optional: Connect your tools

If you use external tools, you can connect them to keep everything in sync.

### Calendar sync
1. Go to **Settings > Calendars**.
2. Click **Add Calendar**.
3. Paste an **iCal URL** from Google Calendar, Outlook, or Apple Calendar.
4. Your events will appear on the MONOid calendar (syncs roughly every hour).

### Linear or Notion
1. Go to **Settings > Integrations**.
2. Connect your **Linear** or **Notion** account via OAuth.
3. Configure automations — e.g. "when an issue is created in Linear team X, create a task in MONOid."
4. See the [Notion](/integrations/app-integrations/01-notion) and [Linear](/integrations/app-integrations/02-linear) docs for details.

## For teams and enterprise

MONOid supports **organisation workspaces** where team members share containers, projects, and review templates. Org admins can manage integrations, templates, and permissions at the workspace level.

If you have enterprise requirements (SSO, admin controls, compliance, custom workflows, data import/export), contact us at [support@usemonoid.com](mailto:support@usemonoid.com).

## What to focus on in week 1

- **Keep it small.** 2–3 containers, a handful of projects, 5–10 tasks.
- **Plan less than you can do.** A believable week beats an ambitious one.
- **Use the Calendar daily.** Drag tasks into blocks each morning.
- **Check My Inbox.** Triage unscheduled tasks so nothing gets lost.
- **Do your first Weekly Review.** Close loops and set up the next week.

After your first week, you'll have a feel for the rhythm. From there, explore [Kanban](/planning/04-kanban) for status tracking, [review templates](/reviews/05-templates) for deeper reflection, and [integrations](/integrations/01-integrations) to connect your stack.
