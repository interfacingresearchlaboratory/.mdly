## Containers, Projects & Tasks

The core structure in **MONOid** is:

**Containers → Projects → Tasks**

- **Containers** hold groups of projects (e.g. *Work*, *Studio*, *Home*).
- **Projects** live inside containers and represent ongoing efforts with outcomes.
- **Tasks** are the concrete actions that move things forward. A task can optionally belong to a project, or exist independently (e.g. standalone to-dos).

This structure keeps planning simple: you always know **where** something belongs and **why** it exists — but you're not forced to assign every task to a project before you can work with it.

## Routine Blocks

Routine Blocks live on the **week** and define the structure of your time — the recurring modes you want your week to follow (e.g. *Deep Work*, *Admin*, *Meetings*).

A Routine Block has two main jobs:

1. **Allowed Projects**  
   Each block can be configured with which projects are allowed inside it.

2. **Task Assignment**  
   Tasks are assigned into Routine Blocks so your plan becomes schedulable and intentional — not just a list.

## Reviews

Reviews are the reflection layer that keeps your system honest and adaptable.

MONOid supports reviews across multiple time horizons:

- **Daily**
- **Weekly**
- **Monthly**
- **Quarterly**
- **Annual**

Use reviews to close loops, reset priorities, and make sure your projects and tasks stay aligned with what you actually want to do.

## Planning Surfaces

MONOid has a few core "surfaces" for planning and sorting tasks. They work together:

### Calendar (Weekly + Daily)
The main calendar view is where planning becomes real.

- Toggle between **Weekly** and **Daily** views
- The **left panel** shows **upcoming tasks to be planned**
- The **right panel** shows **backlog tasks**

This view is designed for shaping the week: pulling tasks in, assigning them into the right time structure, and keeping the plan believable.

### My Inbox (Unscheduled Tasks)
My Inbox is where tasks land when they aren't scheduled yet.

Use it to quickly sort:
- what should be planned this week
- what belongs in the backlog
- what needs reassignment to a different project

### Kanban (All Tasks)
The Kanban view shows **all tasks** in a flow-oriented format.

It's useful when you want to:
- manage task status across projects
- spot bottlenecks
- get a high-level sense of progress without the calendar

## Index Pages (Lists, Filters, Display Config)

Each major entity (Containers, Projects, Tasks, Routine Blocks, Reviews) has an index page that supports:

- **List view**
- **Filtering**
- **Display configuration** (choose which properties you see and how they're shown)

This makes it easy to zoom out, reorganize, and inspect your system without needing to be inside the calendar.
