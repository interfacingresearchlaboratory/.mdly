title: How to Connect Linear and Sync Tasks
description: Connect Linear to MONOid, configure automations, and get your first issue synced as a task

This guide walks you through connecting Linear to MONOid — from the OAuth connection to seeing your first Linear issue appear as a task. It takes about 5 minutes.

## What you'll do

1. Connect your Linear account
2. Select which Linear teams to sync
3. Configure automations (what happens when issues are created)
4. Verify tasks are syncing

---

## 1. Connect your Linear account

1. Open **Settings** from the gear icon at the bottom of the left sidebar.
2. Go to the **Integrations** tab.
3. Find **Linear** and click **Connect**.
4. You'll be redirected to Linear's OAuth page — authorise MONOid to access your Linear workspace.
5. After authorising, you're redirected back to MONOid. The connection is now active.

MONOid requests the minimum permissions needed: read access to your teams, projects, and issues, plus webhook access to receive updates.

## 2. Select teams to sync

After connecting, you'll see your Linear teams listed. Choose which teams MONOid should listen to:

- Select teams that are relevant to your MONOid containers and projects.
- You can always add or remove teams later from the same settings page.

## 3. Configure automations

Automations define what MONOid does when something happens in Linear. The most common setup:

**When a Linear issue is created → Create a MONOid task**

For each team, configure:

- **Target container** — Which MONOid container should receive tasks from this team? (e.g. Linear team "Engineering" → MONOid container "Work")
- **Target project** — Optionally map to a specific project within the container.
- **What to sync:**
  - **Issues → Tasks** — Each Linear issue becomes a MONOid task.
  - **Projects → Projects** — Linear projects map to MONOid projects.
  - **Teams → Containers** — Linear teams map to MONOid containers.

## 4. Verify the sync

Once automations are configured, create a test issue in Linear (or wait for a teammate to create one). Within a few seconds:

1. The issue should appear as a **task** in MONOid.
2. Check the task's detail page — it will have an **external link** badge (the Linear icon) linking back to the original issue.
3. The task will be in the container and project you configured.

You can find synced tasks in **My Inbox** (if unscheduled), on the **Tasks** index page, or by searching.

## How sync works going forward

- **Linear → MONOid:** When issues are created or updated in Linear, webhooks notify MONOid and tasks are created or updated automatically.
- **Status sync:** Status changes in Linear flow to MONOid. If you move an issue to "Done" in Linear, the task status updates in MONOid.
- **One-way for creation:** Tasks are created from Linear issues, not the other way around. You can still create tasks directly in MONOid that aren't linked to Linear.

## Troubleshooting

- **Tasks aren't appearing?** Check that the team is selected and automations are configured in Settings > Integrations. Webhooks can be delayed during Linear outages.
- **Wrong container or project?** Edit the automation mapping in Settings > Integrations. Future issues will use the new mapping; existing tasks aren't retroactively moved.
- **Connection lost?** Go to Settings > Integrations, disconnect Linear, and reconnect. This re-establishes the OAuth token and webhooks.
