This guide walks you through a full weekly planning session in MONOid — from triaging unscheduled tasks to scheduling them into routine blocks on the Calendar. It takes about 15–20 minutes once you have your [routine blocks set up](/guides/04-set-up-routine-blocks).

## What you'll do

1. Triage unscheduled tasks in My Inbox
2. Set task buckets and priorities
3. Schedule tasks into routine blocks on the Calendar
4. Review and adjust in day view

## 1. Triage My Inbox

My Inbox is where unscheduled tasks land — from integrations, quick captures, or tasks you haven't processed yet.

1. Open **My Inbox** from the left sidebar.
2. Switch between the **This week** and **This month** tabs to see what needs attention.
3. For each task, decide one of three things:
   - **This week** — Set the bucket to *todo* or *shaping*. These tasks will appear in the Calendar's left sidebar, ready to be scheduled.
   - **Backlog** — Leave it for a future week. It stays in the right sidebar on the Calendar.
   - **Reassign** — If it's in the wrong project, right-click and move it.

> **Tip:** Don't try to plan everything. A good week has 60–70% of your time committed, with the rest left as buffer. If in doubt, leave it in backlog.

## 2. Shape on the Calendar (week view)

Once you've triaged, switch to the Calendar to schedule tasks into time.

1. Click **Home** in the sidebar to open the Calendar.
2. Switch to **Week view** (press <kbd>V</kbd> to toggle).
3. Expand the **left sidebar** (<kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>←</kbd>) — you'll see your *shaping* and *todo* tasks grouped by project.
4. Expand the **right sidebar** (<kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>→</kbd>) — you'll see *backlog* tasks.

Now drag tasks from the left sidebar into routine blocks:

- **Match task to block type.** If you have a "Deep Work" block, drag focused coding or writing tasks there. If you have an "Admin" block, drag emails and scheduling tasks there.
- **Spread across the week.** Don't front-load Monday. Distribute tasks so each day has a realistic load.
- **Leave room.** Not every block needs to be full. Unexpected work always shows up.

## 3. Fine-tune in day view

After shaping the week, zoom into individual days for detail.

1. Switch to **Day view** (press <kbd>V</kbd>).
2. Use <kbd>J</kbd> and <kbd>K</kbd> to navigate between days.
3. Check each day:
   - Does the workload feel realistic given the time available?
   - Are there conflicts with calendar events (visible if you've [connected a calendar](/integrations/04-calendar-sync))?
   - Are there gaps where you could pull a backlog task forward?

Move tasks between blocks by dragging. To unschedule a task entirely, drag it back to the right sidebar (backlog).

## 4. Final check

Before you close the planning session:

- **My Inbox should be close to empty.** Every task should have a decision: this week, backlog, or reassigned.
- **Each day should feel achievable.** If a day looks overwhelming, move something to a lighter day or back to backlog.
- **High-priority tasks should be early in the week.** Don't leave your most important work for Friday.

## When to plan

Most people find it works best to plan at one of two times:

- **Friday afternoon** — Close out the current week and set up the next. Good for a clean mental break over the weekend.
- **Monday morning** — Start the week with a fresh plan. Works if your context changes over the weekend.

Either way, pair it with a [weekly review](/guides/02-run-a-weekly-review) for the best results.
