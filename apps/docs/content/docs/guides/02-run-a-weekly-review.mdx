This guide walks you through a weekly review in MONOid — from setting up your review template to using your reflection to plan the next week. A weekly review takes 15–30 minutes and is the single most valuable habit you can build in the app.

## What you'll do

1. Set up your weekly review template (first time only)
2. Create a weekly review from the Calendar
3. Work through template steps
4. Log accomplishments and disappointments
5. Check the Projects and Tasks panels
6. Turn reflection into action for next week

## 1. Set up your weekly review template (first time only)

Before your first review, configure a template so your reviews have the right prompts. You only need to do this once — after that, every weekly review uses your template automatically.

1. Go to **Settings** (gear icon at the bottom of the sidebar).
2. Navigate to **Workspaces > Personal** (or your organisation workspace).
3. Open **Reviews** and select the **Weekly** type.
4. Add **steps** — these are the prompts you'll answer each week. Good starting steps:
   - "What did I accomplish this week?"
   - "What didn't go as planned?"
   - "What should I prioritise next week?"
   - "Is there anything I should stop, start, or change?"
5. Save the template.

You can add more steps over time as you learn what questions are most useful for you. See [Templates](/reviews/05-templates) for details on personal vs org templates and how they merge.

> **Tip:** Start with 3–5 steps. Too many steps makes the review feel like a chore; too few and you'll skip important reflection. You can always adjust later.

## 2. Create the review

The fastest way to start a review is from the **Calendar**:

1. Click **Home** in the sidebar to open the Calendar.
2. At the bottom of the Calendar, you'll see review entries for the current period — click **Weekly** to open or create this week's review.
3. The review opens with your template steps loaded and ready to go.

If you've already created a review for this week, clicking opens it where you left off.

## 3. Work through the template steps

The left panel shows your review **steps** — ordered prompts from your [review template](/reviews/05-templates). Each step has a checkbox and a rich text editor.

1. Start at the top and work through each step in order.
2. Write your response in the editor. Be honest and specific — this is for you.
3. Check the box when you're done with each step.

Steps are badged to show where they came from:

- **Personal** — From your personal template. Only you can see your responses.
- **Org** — From your organisation template. Responses are visible to org admins.
- **Container** — From a container-level template.

> **Tip:** Don't overthink your answers. A few sentences per step is plenty. The goal is structured reflection, not long-form writing.

## 4. Log accomplishments and disappointments

Scroll to the **Accomplishments and Disappointments** section below the steps.

### Accomplishments

1. Click to add a row in the **Accomplishments** table.
2. Enter a title — be specific (e.g. "Shipped onboarding flow" not "Made progress").
3. Optionally add a description for more context.
4. **Link to projects and tasks** — Use the selectors to connect each accomplishment to the relevant project or task. This creates traceable connections you can review in monthly/quarterly reviews.

### Disappointments

1. Click to add a row in the **Disappointments** table.
2. Enter what didn't go as planned — be factual, not self-critical.
3. Link to projects and tasks where relevant.

> **Tip:** Disappointments aren't failures. They're data. The things that didn't work are often the most useful inputs for planning the next week. Did you over-commit? Was there a blocker you didn't anticipate? Was the priority wrong?

## 5. Check the Projects and Tasks panels

The right panel shows two tabs:

- **Projects** — All projects that were active during the review week. Check: did the projects you intended to move forward actually move?
- **Tasks** — All tasks that were in scope for the week. Check: what got done, what's still in progress, what never got started?

Use these panels to spot:

- **Stuck work** — Tasks that stayed "in progress" all week may need to be split, re-scoped, or dropped.
- **Unplanned wins** — Work that got done even though it wasn't in the plan. Worth acknowledging.
- **Scope creep** — Tasks that appeared mid-week and displaced planned work.

## 6. Turn reflection into action

Now use what you've learned to set up the next week:

1. **Update task statuses.** Mark tasks done, move stuck tasks back to backlog or re-prioritise them.
2. **Adjust projects.** If a project isn't making progress week after week, consider pausing it or changing its scope.
3. **Open the Calendar.** With your review fresh in mind, [plan the next week](/guides/01-plan-your-week) — triage My Inbox, drag tasks into routine blocks.

The review → plan loop is the core rhythm of MONOid. Each review informs the next plan; each plan gives the next review something to reflect on.

## When to review

Pick a consistent time and stick with it:

- **Friday afternoon** — Review the week, then plan the next one in the same session.
- **Monday morning** — Review last week before planning the current one.
- **Sunday evening** — Some people prefer a quiet moment before the week starts.

Consistency matters more than the specific day.

## Going deeper

As you build the habit, consider adding:

- **Daily reviews** (5–10 minutes) — Quick end-of-day check-ins. Pair with [daily notes](/planning/05-daily-notes) for richer context in your weekly review.
- **Monthly reviews** — Zoom out to see patterns across weeks. Which projects consistently produce accomplishments? Which keep generating disappointments?
- **Custom template steps** — Tailor your review template to ask the questions that matter most to you. See [Templates](/reviews/05-templates).
