Routines define **how your week is structured** — the recurring time blocks that shape when different types of work happen. While the [organisation layer](/organisation/01-framework) answers "where does this live?" and [planning](/planning/01-planning) answers "when does it happen?", routines answer **"what kind of work belongs here?"**

## Two types of blocks

MONOid uses two types of time blocks on your week:

- **Routine blocks** — Recurring work sessions you design (e.g. *Deep Work*, *Admin*, *Meetings*). Tasks are assigned into these. They repeat weekly based on your template.
- **Daily schedule items** — Fixed life blocks (wake, sleep, meals, custom items like commute or exercise). These mark time that's unavailable for work — tasks cannot be assigned to them.

Both types appear on the [Calendar](/planning/03-calendar) and are managed from the **Routines** page (accessible via the sidebar).

## How routines work

### Templates and weekly patterns

When you create a routine block, you choose which **days of the week** it repeats on. This creates a weekly template — a recurring pattern that shows up on the Calendar each week.

For example, creating a "Deep Work" block on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 9:00–11:00 creates three template entries that repeat every week.

### Date-specific overrides

Sometimes a week doesn't follow the template. You can **override** a routine block for a specific date — change its time, name, or content — without affecting the template. The override applies to that date only; the template continues as normal on other weeks.

Overrides are created when you edit a template block on the Calendar for a specific day.

### Task assignment

Tasks are assigned to routine blocks via drag-and-drop on the Calendar. Each task can be in one block at a time. Tasks within a block can be reordered by dragging.

Assigning tasks to blocks makes your plan **schedulable and intentional** — instead of a flat to-do list, you know what you're working on and when.

## Visual conventions on the Calendar

- **Solid blocks** — Real routine blocks (edited or with tasks assigned). Fully interactive.
- **Faint/outlined blocks** — Template ghosts for time slots you haven't filled yet. Adding a task or editing the block creates a real block and replaces the ghost.
- **Hatched blocks** — Daily schedule items (wake/sleep bands, meals). Tasks cannot be assigned to these.
