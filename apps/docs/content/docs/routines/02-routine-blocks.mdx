## What it is

Routine blocks are the recurring work sessions that structure your week. Each block has a name, time range, colour, and set of days it repeats on. Tasks are assigned into blocks so your plan maps to real time, not just a list.

## Creating a routine block

1. Open **Routines** from the sidebar.
2. Click **Add Routine**.
3. Fill in the details:
   - **Name** — a short label for the block (e.g. "Deep Work", "Admin", "1:1s").
   - **Days of week** — which days the block repeats on (multi-select).
   - **Start time / End time** — when the block starts and ends.
   - **Colour** — pick from presets or enter a custom hex colour.
4. Save. The block appears on the Routines page and on the Calendar for the selected days.

## Editing and resizing

- **Click a block** on the Routines page or Calendar to open the edit dialog. You can change the name, time, colour, and content (notes).
- **Drag the top or bottom edge** of a block on the Calendar to resize it. Blocks snap to 15-minute intervals with a minimum duration of 15 minutes.
- Edits on the Routines page update the **template** (all future weeks). Edits on the Calendar for a specific day create a **date-specific override** that only applies to that date.

## Templates and overrides

Routine blocks follow a **template + override** model:

- **Template blocks** define the weekly pattern. They have a day of week (Monday, Tuesday, etc.) and repeat every week.
- **Override blocks** are created when you edit a template block on the Calendar for a specific date. The override stores only the fields that changed. The template continues as normal on other weeks.

This means you can adjust a single day (e.g. move "Deep Work" to the afternoon on a specific Wednesday) without disrupting your weekly structure.

## Assigning tasks

Open the [Calendar](/planning/03-calendar) and drag tasks from the sidebars into a routine block:

- **Left sidebar** — shaping and todo tasks (in scope for the week).
- **Right sidebar** — backlog tasks (unscheduled).

Tasks within a block can be reordered by dragging. Each task can only be in one block at a time. To unschedule a task, drag it back to the backlog sidebar.

Opening a routine block on the Calendar shows its assigned tasks with their status and project.

## Content and notes

Each routine block has an optional **content** field — free-form notes or context about what the block is for. Edit it from the block's detail dialog.

## Colours

Routine blocks support custom colours. Colours help visually distinguish different types of work on the Calendar (e.g. blue for deep work, green for meetings, orange for admin). Pick from the preset palette or enter a hex code.

## Categories

Routine blocks can be tagged with a [category](/organisation/05-categories) for filtering and grouping.

## Tips

- **Name blocks by mode, not project.** "Deep Work" is better than "ProjectX" — modes are reusable across projects and weeks.
- **Leave gaps.** A wall-to-wall schedule is fragile. Buffer time between blocks keeps the week realistic.
- **Use overrides sparingly.** If you're overriding the same block every week, update the template instead.
