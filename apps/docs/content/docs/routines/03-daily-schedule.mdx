## What it is

Daily schedule items define the **non-work structure** of your day — wake time, sleep time, meals, and any other fixed commitments. They appear on the Calendar as hatched blocks and mark time that's unavailable for task assignment.

Unlike [routine blocks](/routines/02-routine-blocks), daily schedule items are purely informational. They help you see your full day and ensure your plan stays realistic by showing when you're actually available.

## Setting wake and sleep times

1. Open **Routines** from the sidebar.
2. Click **Wake & Sleep**.
3. Set a **wake time** and **sleep time** for each day of the week.
4. Save.

Wake and sleep times appear as hashed bands at the top and bottom of each day on the Calendar. On the Calendar, you can also drag the solid line at the edge of a wake/sleep band to adjust times directly.

## Adding daily schedule items

1. On the Routines page, click **Add Daily Schedule**.
2. Choose a type:
   - **Breakfast**, **Lunch**, **Dinner** — preset meal slots.
   - **Custom** — any fixed commitment (e.g. "Commute", "Gym", "School pickup").
3. Set a **start time** and **end time** for each day of the week.
4. Save.

Each item is configured per day — Monday can have lunch at 12:00 while Friday has it at 13:00.

## Quick fill

When setting times, you can apply the same time to multiple days at once:

- **All days** — apply to every day of the week.
- **Weekdays** — apply to Monday through Friday.
- **Weekends** — apply to Saturday and Sunday.

This saves time when your schedule is mostly consistent. You can then adjust individual days as needed.

## How schedule items appear

- **Hatched/striped blocks** on the Calendar, visually distinct from solid routine blocks.
- Tasks **cannot** be dragged into daily schedule items.
- Schedule items help the Calendar calculate your **available work hours** for each day.

## Deleting a schedule item

To remove a daily schedule item, clear its start and end times for all days and save. Items with no times are automatically removed.

## Tips

- **Set wake and sleep first.** This establishes the boundaries of your day and makes the Calendar immediately more useful.
- **Meals are optional but helpful.** Even rough meal times help you see realistic work windows.
- **Use custom items for recurring commitments** that aren't work — commutes, school runs, exercise. They won't accept tasks but they'll prevent you from over-scheduling.
