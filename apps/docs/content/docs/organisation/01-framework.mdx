## What it is

The **organisation** layer in MONOid is the hierarchy that structures your work: **Containers → Projects → Tasks**. It answers "where does this live?" and "why does it exist?" so you can scope views, filter index pages, and connect work to your week.

## When to use it

- You want to separate areas of life or work (e.g. Work, Studio, Home) and keep projects grouped.
- You need to see lists or boards scoped to one container or one project.
- You're planning the week and want tasks tied to projects (and projects to containers) so routine blocks and reviews make sense.

## How it works

Containers are the top level; each contains projects. Projects contain tasks. Tasks can also exist without a project — for example, quick to-dos captured before you decide where they belong. Index pages (Containers, Projects, Tasks) can show everything or be scoped to a parent (e.g. "projects in this container"). The week and routine blocks then reference projects and tasks, so your plan stays aligned with your structure.

## How to use it

1. Create one or more **containers** (e.g. Work, Studio, Home) from the Containers index.
2. Create **projects** inside a container from the Projects index (or from a container's detail page).
3. Create **tasks** inside a project from the Tasks index, calendar, or project detail. Tasks can also be created without a project.
4. Use filters and grouping on index pages to view by container or project as needed.

## Key concepts / fields

- **Container** — Top-level group of projects; has a name and optional notes.
- **Project** — Belongs to one container; represents an ongoing effort with an outcome; can be linked to routine blocks.
- **Task** — Optionally belongs to a project; has a bucket (status), dates, and can be assigned to a routine block for the week. Tasks without a project appear in "No project" groups.

## Common workflows

- **Set up from scratch:** Create containers → add projects to each → add tasks to projects; then configure routine blocks and plan the week.
- **Scope a view:** Open the Projects index and filter or group by container to focus on one area.
- **Weekly planning:** Open the calendar, pull tasks from the backlog into the right routine blocks, and move between projects as needed.
- **Review and tidy:** Use index pages (list/kanban) to see status across containers and projects, then archive or reassign as needed.

## Tips + gotchas

- Put every project in a container so scoping and filters stay consistent.
- If a task outlives its project, move it to another project (or a "holding" project) rather than leaving it orphaned — or let it exist without a project until you decide.
- Use the same organisation structure when you run reviews so priorities and outcomes stay aligned.
