## What it is

Categories are lightweight tags you can apply to entities across MONOid. They help you filter, group, and visually distinguish items — without changing the container/project/task hierarchy.

For example, you might create categories like *Frontend*, *Design*, *Operations*, or *Urgent* and apply them across multiple projects and tasks.

## Supported entities

Categories work on four entity types:

- **Projects** — A project can have **multiple categories** (many-to-many). Useful for cross-cutting labels like "Q1 Goals" or "Client Work".
- **Tasks** — A task can have **one category**. Useful for quick filtering (e.g. "Bug", "Feature", "Admin").
- **Routine blocks** — Tag blocks by type of work (e.g. "Creative", "Meetings").
- **Routine templates** — Tag templates for organisation.

Each category is scoped to an entity type — a project category and a task category with the same name are separate entries.

## Creating and managing categories

Categories are created inline when you assign one to an entity. You can also manage them from filter and grouping controls on index pages.

Each category has:
- **Name** — The label (e.g. "Design", "Sprint 3").
- **Colour** — Optional. Adds a visual marker on cards, badges, and calendar blocks.

## Using categories for filtering and grouping

Categories appear in the filter and display config controls on index pages:

- **Filter by category** — Show only items with a specific category. Available on Projects, Tasks, Kanban, Calendar, My Inbox, and Reviews.
- **Group by category** — Organise items into groups based on their category. Available in list and kanban views.

This is useful when you need a cross-cutting view that doesn't follow the container/project hierarchy — for example, seeing all "Design" tasks across every project, or grouping your kanban board by category instead of status.

## Tips

- **Keep categories flat.** Categories don't nest. If you need hierarchy, use containers and projects instead.
- **Use colour consistently.** If "Design" is blue in one place, make it blue everywhere.
- **Don't over-tag.** A few well-chosen categories are more useful than a dozen that overlap. If you find yourself creating categories that mirror your project structure, you probably don't need them.
