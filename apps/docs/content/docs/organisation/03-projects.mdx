## What it is

**Projects** are ongoing efforts with an outcome. They live inside one **container** and can contain **tasks**. Projects are the middle layer of MONOid's hierarchy: they group tasks and can be linked to **routine blocks** so that only relevant projects (and their tasks) show up in a given time block.

## When to use it

- You have a goal or outcome that spans multiple tasks (e.g. "Launch feature X", "Plan holiday").
- You want to see all tasks for one effort in one place (list, kanban, or calendar).
- You want to restrict which projects can be planned in which routine blocks (e.g. "Deep Work" only for certain projects).

## How it works

Each project belongs to exactly one container. Tasks can optionally belong to a project — when they do, they inherit the project's container context. The Projects index shows all projects (or those in a scoped container); you can use list view, kanban, grouping, and filters. Project detail pages show the project's tasks and metadata. Routine blocks can be configured with "allowed projects" so the calendar only offers tasks from those projects in that block.

## How to use it

1. Open the **Projects** index from the sidebar (or create from a container's detail page).
2. Create a project: set its **container**, name, and optional notes.
3. Add **tasks** to the project from the Tasks index, calendar, or project detail.
4. Optionally link the project to **routine blocks** so it appears in the right planning context.
5. Use list or kanban view, and group or filter by container, status, or other fields as needed.

## Key concepts / fields

- **Container** — The parent container; every project must have one.
- **Name** — The project's label (e.g. "Launch feature X").
- **Notes** — Context, outcome, or decisions; the "why" for the project.
- **Routine blocks** — Which blocks allow this project (and thus its tasks) for planning.
- **Tasks** — The list of tasks in this project (visible on the project detail page).

## Common workflows

- **Start a new effort:** Create a project under the right container, add a few tasks, then pull tasks into the week via the calendar.
- **Scope by container:** Filter or group the Projects index by container to focus on Work, Studio, or Home.
- **Weekly planning:** Open the calendar; tasks from allowed projects appear in the right routine blocks; assign and reorder as needed.
- **Review and close:** In a weekly or monthly review, check project progress on the index or detail page, archive completed projects, and move or reassign stray tasks.

## Tips + gotchas

- Give projects clear outcomes so you know when they're "done" and can archive them.
- Use routine block "allowed projects" to avoid mixing unrelated work in the same block.
- If a project grows too large, consider splitting it into two projects under the same container rather than one huge list of tasks.
