## What it is

**Tasks** are the concrete actions that move work forward. A task can optionally belong to a **project** (and thus to that project's **container**), but tasks can also exist on their own — for example, standalone to-dos or items captured before you decide where they belong. Tasks have a bucket (status), and can be assigned to **routine blocks** on the week so your plan is schedulable and intentional.

## When to use it

- You need to capture and track discrete actions (e.g. "Write spec", "Book flight").
- You want to plan the week by assigning tasks into time blocks (calendar) or sort unscheduled tasks (inbox).
- You want to see progress in a list or kanban view, grouped by status, project, or container.

## How it works

Tasks can live inside projects or exist independently. They can be unscheduled (backlog), scheduled into a routine block for a given day/week, or marked done. The Tasks index supports list and kanban views, grouping, and filters. The **calendar** lets you pull tasks into the week and assign them to blocks; **My Inbox** helps you triage unscheduled tasks. Task detail pages show notes and a property sidebar (bucket, project, routine block, etc.).

## How to use it

1. Create a task from the **Tasks** index, a **project** detail page, or the **calendar** (e.g. from backlog).
2. Optionally set a **project** (and thus container), choose a **bucket**, and fill in any other fields.
3. To plan the week: open the **calendar**, choose a routine block and day, and move tasks from the left (upcoming) or right (backlog) into the block.
4. Use **My Inbox** to triage unscheduled tasks: plan this week, leave in backlog, or reassign to another project.
5. Use **list** or **kanban** on the Tasks index to review and bulk-edit status or project.

## Key concepts / fields

- **Project** — The parent project (optional); determines the container indirectly when set. Tasks without a project appear in "No project" groups.
- **Bucket** — The task's workflow stage. The full set of buckets is: **Backlog**, **Shaping**, **Todo**, **In Progress**, **In Review**, **Done**, **Cancelled**. Buckets drive kanban columns, calendar sidebars, and filters.
  - *Backlog* — captured but not yet in scope for the week.
  - *Shaping* — being defined or scoped; not ready to start.
  - *Todo* — ready to work on this week.
  - *In Progress* — actively being worked on.
  - *In Review* — work is done but awaiting review or sign-off.
  - *Done* — completed.
  - *Cancelled* — dropped or no longer relevant.
- **Dates** — Due date, scheduled date, or both; used in calendar and list views.
- **Routine block** — When scheduled, the block (and optionally day) the task is assigned to for the week.

## Common workflows

- **Capture and plan:** Add tasks to a project as they come up; each week pull from backlog into the calendar and assign to routine blocks.
- **Inbox triage:** Open My Inbox, decide what's this week vs. backlog, and reassign any task that belongs to a different project.
- **Kanban flow:** Use the Tasks kanban to move tasks through bucket columns across projects; group by project or container if you need context.
- **Review and close:** After a review, mark tasks done, archive or delete completed ones, and move stray tasks to the right project.

## Tips + gotchas

- Keep tasks actionable (one clear action); split large items into multiple tasks.
- Use My Inbox regularly so unscheduled tasks don't pile up and the backlog stays meaningful.
- When moving a task to another project, check that the routine block still makes sense (allowed projects on the block).
- Tasks without a project are still fully functional — you can schedule them, assign them to blocks, and move them through buckets. Assign a project when the task belongs to a clear effort.
