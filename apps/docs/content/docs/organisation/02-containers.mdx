## What it is

**Containers** are the top level of MONOid’s organisation hierarchy. Each container holds a set of projects. They don’t have tasks directly — only projects do. Use containers to separate areas of life or work (e.g. Work, Studio, Home, Admin) so you can filter and group by context.

## When to use it

- You have multiple “buckets” of work (e.g. job, side projects, family) and want projects grouped under each.
- You want to open the Projects index and see only projects in one container, or group by container.
- You want to keep routine blocks and reviews aligned with specific areas (e.g. “Deep Work” only for Work container projects).

## How it works

Containers are folders for projects. Every project belongs to exactly one container. The Containers index lists all containers; the Projects index can show all projects or be scoped to “projects in this container.” Grouping and filters on index pages use the container relationship so you can reshape the same data by context.

## How to use it

1. Open the **Containers** index from the sidebar.
2. Create a new container (e.g. Work, Studio, Home); add a name and optional notes.
3. When creating or editing a project, set its **container** to one of your containers.
4. On the Projects index, use filters or grouping by container to scope what you see.

## Key concepts / fields

- **Name** — The label for the container (e.g. Work, Studio, Home).
- **Notes** — Optional context or rules for what belongs in this container.
- **Projects** — The list of projects inside this container (visible on the container’s detail page under a Tasks/Projects tab, depending on your app).

## Common workflows

- **Initial setup:** Create 2–3 containers that match how you think about your work (e.g. Work, Personal, Admin), then create projects under each.
- **Focus on one area:** Filter the Projects index by container so you only see projects in “Work” (or another container).
- **Review by area:** In a weekly or monthly review, open each container’s projects and tasks to close loops and reprioritise per area.
- **Routine block alignment:** When configuring routine blocks, restrict “allowed projects” to a container (or subset) so the right work appears in the right blocks.

## Tips + gotchas

- Keep the number of containers small (e.g. 3–5); too many makes filtering noisy.
- Name containers by context or area, not by status (e.g. “Work” not “Active”).
- If you merge two areas, move projects into one container and archive or delete the empty one to avoid clutter.
