A **review template** is a reusable set of **steps** (prompts or to-dos) and optional **embeds** (Notion pages, Linear boards) that define the structure of a review. Templates are scoped to a **review type** (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, etc.) so each cadence has its own structure.

## Templates are layered

Each review is generated from up to three layers of templates:

- **Personal** — yours, private by default. Created in Settings > Review Templates.
- **Organisation** — shared across the org, managed by admins. Created in workspace settings.
- **Container** — scoped to a specific container, if configured.

When you create a review, the app **merges** applicable templates into one guided flow. Personal steps appear first, then organisation, then container. Each step is badged so you know its origin, and **response visibility follows the step's source** — org-step responses are visible to admins; personal-step responses are visible only to you.

One template per type per scope can be set as **default**. Only defaults are included in the merge.

For the full merging rules, see [How templates merge](/reviews/08-how-templates-merge). For visibility details, see [Responses and permissions](/reviews/10-responses-and-permissions).
