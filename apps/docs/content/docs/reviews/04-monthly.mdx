A monthly review covers **one calendar month** (first day to last day). You create one from the Reviews index (Create Review > Monthly); the app derives the month from the review date.

## What makes monthly reviews different

- **Period is a full calendar month.** Accomplishments, disappointments, and the Projects/Tasks panels are scoped to the month. Good for spotting patterns that don't show up day-to-day or week-to-week.
- **Scheduling options.** In Settings you can configure when you run monthly reviews: first day of month, last day, first Monday (or any day of week), last Monday (or any day of week), or a custom day (1–31). This sets your rhythm — the app doesn't auto-create.
- **Longer-horizon prompts.** Monthly templates typically include questions about goals, direction, and what to change — not just "what shipped."

## Quarterly and annual reviews

The app also supports **Quarterly** and **Annual** review types. They work identically to Monthly but with a quarter or year as the period. Scheduling options (e.g. last day of quarter, first day) are in Settings. These types may require a higher plan tier.
