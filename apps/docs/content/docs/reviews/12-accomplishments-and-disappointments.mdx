## What they are

Accomplishments and disappointments are structured reflection entries you create during a [review](/reviews/01-overview). They answer two simple questions:

- **Accomplishments** — What went well? What shipped, what progress was made, what are you proud of?
- **Disappointments** — What didn't go as planned? What slipped, what was blocked, what would you do differently?

Each entry is tied to the review it was created in and inherits the review's **scope** (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, or annual).

## How to use them

Accomplishments and disappointments are created directly within a review's detail page:

1. Open a review from the **Reviews** page.
2. Scroll to the **Accomplishments and Disappointments** section (collapsible, near the bottom of the page).
3. The section is split into two tables: **Accomplishments** (top) and **Disappointments** (bottom).
4. Click to add a new row in either table.
5. Fill in:
   - **Title** — A short description of the accomplishment or disappointment.
   - **Description** — Optional longer context.
6. Save. The entry is linked to the current review.

Both tables support inline editing — click any field to update it.

## Linking to projects and tasks

Each accomplishment or disappointment can be linked to one or more **projects** and **tasks**. This creates a traceable connection between your reflection and the actual work.

- Use the **project selector** to link relevant projects.
- Use the **task selector** to link specific tasks.

Linking is optional but valuable — it helps you see patterns over time (which projects produce accomplishments? which tend to generate disappointments?) and gives context when reviewing past periods.

## Scope and visibility

- **Scope** is inherited from the review type. A weekly review's accomplishments are scoped to that week; a monthly review's are scoped to that month.
- **Visibility** follows the same rules as other review content — entries in a review are visible to you, and to org admins if the review contains org-scoped steps. See [Responses and Permissions](/reviews/10-responses-and-permissions).

## Viewing past accomplishments

Accomplishments and disappointments are stored with the review they belong to. To look back:

- Open a past review to see its entries.
- Accomplishments are also included in [data exports](/getting-started/05-settings#export) (Settings > Export).

## Tips

- **Be specific.** "Shipped the onboarding flow" is more useful than "Made progress." Specificity makes reviews valuable when you look back months later.
- **Link to projects.** Even if it takes an extra second, the connection pays off during monthly and quarterly reviews when you're looking for patterns.
- **Don't skip disappointments.** They're not failures — they're data. The things that didn't go well are often the most useful inputs for planning the next period.
- **Keep it short.** One line per entry is fine. The goal is structured capture, not long-form writing.
