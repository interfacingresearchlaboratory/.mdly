When you open a review, the left side shows **steps** in a single ordered list. This is the merged template in action — personal steps first, then org, then container. Each step has a **checkbox** and a **rich-text editor** for your notes.

## The steps panel

- **Order** follows the [merge order](/reviews/08-how-templates-merge): all personal steps in template order, then all org steps, then all container steps. You see one continuous list, not separate blocks.
- **Badges** — Each step is labelled **Org** or **Personal** (or **Container**) so you know which template it came from and, therefore, who can see your response.
- **Completion** — Check the box to mark a step done. Some steps (header-type) auto-complete when the editor has content; manual steps require an explicit check.
- **Progress** — The panel shows progress (e.g. "3 of 5 completed"). When all steps are done, the panel indicates completion visually.
- **Collapse** — Use **Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+E** to collapse the steps panel and give more space to the editors and side panels.

## Steps are fixed at creation

The step list is determined when you create the review and does not change after that. If someone updates the org template later (adds a step, removes one, reorders), your existing review keeps its original steps and responses. Only new reviews pick up template changes. See [How templates merge](/reviews/08-how-templates-merge).

## Step–embed link

A step can be linked to one or two **embeds** from the template. When you focus that step, the right panel can switch to show those specific embeds instead of all tabs — so the right context appears alongside the right prompt. See [Review Embeds](/reviews/11-review-embeds).

## Right panel: Projects, Tasks, and Embeds

The right side of the review shows:

- **Projects** and **Tasks** tabs — work in scope for the review's period.
- **Embeds** — tabs for each external resource from the merged templates (deduplicated). Switch tabs to see different embeds, or let step focus drive which embed appears.
