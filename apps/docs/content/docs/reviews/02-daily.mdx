A daily review covers **one day**. You create one from the Reviews index (Create Review > Daily); the app uses your default Daily template so you get the same steps and embeds each time.

## What makes daily reviews different

- **Scope is a single day.** Accomplishments, disappointments, and the Tasks panel are all filtered to that date. The Tasks panel shows tasks linked to routine blocks for that day, so you can compare what was planned with what actually happened.
- **Short and repeatable.** Daily reviews work best as a lightweight ritual — 5-10 minutes at the end of the day or as a morning kickoff. Typical steps: what you shipped, what blocked you, top priorities for tomorrow.
- **No auto-creation.** You create daily reviews when you want them. Use a reminder or habit if you want a consistent cadence.

To review a past day, create a daily review and set the date, or open an existing one from the Reviews index.
