A weekly review covers **one week**. You create one from the Reviews index (Create Review > Weekly); the app derives the week from the review date and your **first day of week** preference (e.g. Monday–Sunday).

## What makes weekly reviews different

- **Period is a full week.** Accomplishments, disappointments, and the Projects/Tasks panels are scoped to that week. You see everything that moved — not just one day.
- **Review day setting.** In Settings you can set a preferred weekly review day (e.g. Friday). This is for your rhythm; the app doesn't auto-create the review for you.
- **Bridge between reflect and plan.** Weekly reviews pair naturally with weekly planning: run through the template, log wins and blockers, then switch to Calendar or My Inbox to triage and schedule the next week.

Creating two weekly reviews in the same week gives you two separate reviews for the same period — usually you want one per week.
