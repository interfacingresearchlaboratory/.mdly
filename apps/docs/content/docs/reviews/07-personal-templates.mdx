Personal templates are review templates that **you** create and own. They're managed in **Settings > Review Templates** and are **private by default** — only you can see them, and only you can see responses to steps that come from your personal template.

When you create a review, your personal default for that type is merged with any applicable organisation and container templates. Personal steps appear **first** in the merged order, so your own prompts (e.g. "How was my energy today?", "One thing to improve") come before the team's shared questions.

Set one personal template as **default** per review type (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, etc.). If you don't set a personal default, the review will still include org/container steps — but you'll miss having your own prompts in the flow.
