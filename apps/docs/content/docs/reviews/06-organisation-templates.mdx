Organisation templates are review templates owned by a **workspace**. They're created and managed by **org admins** and define the shared structure — standard reflection questions, mandatory prompts, and common embeds — that every org member sees when they create a review.

## Setup

1. Go to **Settings > Workspace > Review Templates**.
2. Select the **review type** (e.g. Weekly).
3. Create or edit a template: add **steps** (label, optional description, optional embed links) and **embeds**. Reorder steps as needed.
4. **Set as default** for that type. Only the default is merged into members' reviews.

## Visibility

Responses to organisation-template steps are visible to **org admins**. They are not visible to other org members. Personal-step responses are never accessible to admins — even though both appear in the same review session. See [Responses and permissions](/reviews/10-responses-and-permissions).

In the review UI, org-sourced steps are badged **Org** so users know exactly which responses are shared.

## Versioning

Changes to an organisation template (adding, removing, or reordering steps) affect **future reviews only**. Existing reviews keep the step set they were created with — they're a snapshot of the template at creation time. This means past reviews don't gain new steps or lose removed ones when an admin updates the template.
