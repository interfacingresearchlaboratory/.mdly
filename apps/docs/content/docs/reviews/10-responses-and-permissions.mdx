**Visibility is step-scoped.** Responses inherit visibility from the step that generated them:

- **Organisation-template steps** — responses are visible to **organisation admins**.
- **Personal-template steps** — responses are visible **only to you**.

This is the single rule. One review can contain both org and personal steps; each response follows its own step's visibility.

## What this means in practice

- **You see everything in your own review.** When you open your review, you see all steps (org + personal) and all your responses. The boundary only matters when someone else views your data.
- **Admins see the org layer only.** Organisation admins can view org-step responses across the team. They cannot access personal-step responses — the product enforces this even though both run in the same review session.
- **Exports and embeds respect the same boundary.** An org-level export includes only org-step responses. A personal export includes everything. If review data is embedded elsewhere (e.g. in a dashboard), the same rules apply.

In the review UI, steps are badged **Org** or **Personal** so the boundary is always visible. If you're not sure whether a response is shared, check the badge.
