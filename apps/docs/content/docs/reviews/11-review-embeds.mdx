Review embeds are external resources — Notion pages, Notion databases, Linear teams, Linear projects — that appear inside the review UI so you can reference them without leaving MONOid. Embeds are defined on **templates** and collected from all merged templates when a review is created.

## How embeds work

Each template can have an **embeds** list. An embed has a **provider** (e.g. Notion, Linear), a **resource type** (page, database, team, project), a **resource ID**, and a **title**. When the review loads:

1. Embeds from all merged templates (personal + org + container) are collected.
2. Duplicates are removed by (provider, resource type, resource ID) — first occurrence in merge order wins.
3. Embeds appear as **tabs** in the right panel of the review.

The corresponding integration (Notion, Linear) must be connected in Settings for embeds to load.

## Step–embed link

A template step can be linked to one or two embeds. When you **focus** that step in the review, the right panel switches to show those specific embeds instead of all tabs. This puts the right context next to the right prompt — e.g. a Linear sprint board alongside "What shipped this week?"

## Adding embeds to a template

1. Open the template in Settings (personal or workspace Review Templates).
2. In the **Embeds** section, add an embed: choose provider, resource type, and pick the resource. Give it a title.
3. Optionally, edit a step and link it to one or two embeds from the list.
4. Save. New reviews of that type will include the embed.

If both your personal and org templates include the same resource, it appears once (deduplicated). If they include different resources, both appear as separate tabs in merge order.

## Troubleshooting

- **Embed not loading** — Check that the integration (Notion/Linear) is still connected in Settings > Integrations. Reconnect if the token expired.
- **Embed missing from review** — Confirm the embed is on the default template for that review type, and that the template is set as default.
