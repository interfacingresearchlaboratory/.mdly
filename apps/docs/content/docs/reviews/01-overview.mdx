Reviews are structured reflection sessions tied to a **cadence** (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, or annual). Each review follows a **template** that defines the prompts you answer, and surfaces the tasks, projects, and external tools relevant to that period. The goal is simple: look back before looking forward.

## The review loop

Every review follows the same rhythm regardless of cadence:

1. **Collect** — The review surfaces what's in scope: tasks, calendar blocks, notes, and any embeds (Notion, Linear) defined in your template.
2. **Reflect** — Work through the template's steps. Log accomplishments and disappointments; link them to projects or tasks.
3. **Decide** — Use your answers and the Projects/Tasks panels to see what shipped, what's stuck, and what to prioritise.
4. **Commit** — Turn decisions into action: update tasks, move items on Kanban, plan the next period on Calendar or My Inbox.

## What a review contains

- **Steps** — Ordered prompts from your [merged template](/reviews/08-how-templates-merge). Each has a checkbox and a rich-text editor. Steps are badged **Org** or **Personal** so you know where they came from and who can see your response.
- **Accomplishments and Disappointments** — Tied to the review's period and optionally linked to projects and tasks.
- **Projects and Tasks panels** — Work in scope for the review's date range.
- **Embeds** — External resources (Notion pages, Linear boards) defined in the template, shown as tabs in the right panel.

## Cadences

- **[Daily](/reviews/02-daily)** — One day. End-of-day or morning check-in.
- **[Weekly](/reviews/03-weekly)** — One week. Retrospective and next-week planning.
- **[Monthly](/reviews/04-monthly)** — One calendar month. Longer-horizon reflection.
- **Quarterly / Annual** — One quarter or year, for strategic and goal-oriented reviews (if enabled).

Each cadence has its own default templates. When you create a review, the app merges your personal and organisation (and container) templates for that type into a single step list. See [Templates](/reviews/05-templates).

## Templates at a glance

Reviews are generated from **layered templates**: your **personal** template plus any **organisation** and **container** templates. The review interface combines them into one guided flow — personal steps first, then org, then container. Responses are **step-scoped**: org-step responses are visible to org admins; personal-step responses are visible only to you. Details in [How templates merge](/reviews/08-how-templates-merge) and [Responses and permissions](/reviews/10-responses-and-permissions).
