description: Prefer SDKs over raw fetch for data access

## Data access rule

### Prefer SDKs/clients over `fetch`
- Use the official or project-standard SDK/client first (e.g. Convex client + hooks, typed API clients).
- Avoid ad-hoc `fetch()` calls in components and UI flows when an SDK exists.

### When `fetch` is acceptable
- No SDK/client exists for the target API.
- You need a low-level feature the SDK doesn’t expose (e.g. special streaming/headers/caching).
- You are calling a simple internal route handler that is explicitly designed for `fetch`.

### Implementation guidance
- Keep data access in dedicated hooks/services (e.g. `src/lib/api/*` or `src/hooks/*`), not inline in components.
- Preserve typing end-to-end (typed request/response contracts) and reuse the same client across the app.
