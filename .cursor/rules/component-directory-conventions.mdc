## Component location rules (Next.js App Router)

### 1) Page/route-scoped components
If a component is only used by a single route segment, place it in that segment’s `_components` folder.

Example:
- `src/app/projects/_components/projects-sidebar.tsx`

### 2) Shared components
If a component is used by 2+ routes (or is intended to be reusable), place it in:
- `src/components/`

### 3) Naming + intent
- Prefer feature/route-prefixed filenames for route-scoped components (e.g. `projects-sidebar.tsx`) to avoid collisions.
- When unsure, default to route-scoped (`src/app/<segment>/_components`) until reuse is proven.
