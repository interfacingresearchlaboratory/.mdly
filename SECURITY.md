# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

Use one of these private channels:

1. Preferred: GitHub Security Advisories for this repository.
2. If advisories are unavailable, contact the maintainers through private repository ownership channels.

Include:

- vulnerability type and impact
- affected files or endpoints
- proof of concept or reproduction steps
- suggested remediation (if known)

You can expect:

- acknowledgement within 5 business days
- triage and severity assessment
- a coordinated fix and disclosure plan when valid

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are prioritized for:

- the latest commit on `main`
- the latest tagged release (when releases are published)

Older versions may not receive patches.

## Disclosure Process

1. Report is received privately.
2. Maintainers validate and assess severity.
3. A fix is prepared and tested.
4. A release is published with remediation notes.
5. Public disclosure follows after users have had time to upgrade.
